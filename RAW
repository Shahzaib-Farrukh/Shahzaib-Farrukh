Data Centers:

There are three main data centers, with the first two being the most commonly used:

	·     Mahwah - NJRAR - RR
	·     GAALP - Windward - WW
	·     Louisville

Environments:

We work in two primary environments:

	·     Production - CPE
	·     Textnet (also referred to as DEV) - CDE

Operating Systems:

We support two operating systems:

	·     Windows, referred to as WIN
	·     Linux, referred to as LIN

Storage:

There are two types of storage:

	·     SAN (Storage Area Network) - hard disk capacity is greater than 1TB
	·     VSAN (Virtual SAN) - hard disk capacity is less than 1TB
        Note: 1TB = 1024 GB

Clusters:

Clusters are defined by a combination of four factors: Data Center, Environment, Operating System, and Storage. Here are examples of cluster naming conventions:

    NJRAR_CPEWIN_VSAN001: Represents Mahwah (RR) data center, CPE is Production environment, WIN is Windows OS, and VSAN storage.
    GAALP_CDELIN_SAN004: Represents GAALP (WW) data center, CDE Testnet/DEV environment,LIN is  Linux OS, and SAN storage.

Types of Tickets:

There are two main types of tickets:

    Validation Tickets: No sheet attachment is included.
    Virtual Tickets: Includes a sheet attached with an SMC number.

Ticket Validation Guidelines:

    Storage Upgrades:
        Storage upgrades typically involve SAN and VSAN storage.
        Review the ticket to confirm the requirements are correct; if so, simply accept the ticket and close it.

    CPU, Memory, and vMotion Upgrades:
        vMotion Explanation: vMotion is the process of migrating a server from one cluster to another that meets the specified requirements.
        Check the availability of the specified cluster. If unavailable, identify an alternative cluster and perform vMotion.
        Additional Requirement:
            Verify the Number of Sockets: If there is only 1 socket, specify in the request details to "Enable hot add for CPU and Memory."
            If the requirement is CPU-only and there is 1 socket, still include the note to "Enable hot add for CPU and Memory."
            Same as for memory.
If the storage is SAN we need nothing to do just click yes below the table of requirement details.
And if the storage is Vsan we have to assign data store with them too.
Like   NJRAR_CPEWIN_VSAN001 it’s a normal cluster but when we have to assign data store its be like
  NJRAR_CPEWIN_VSAN001_VMP001.
