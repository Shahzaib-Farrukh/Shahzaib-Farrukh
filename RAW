1. Identity and Access Management (IAM):
Principle of Least Privilege: Only provide the minimum necessary permissions to users, roles, and services.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA for all accounts, especially root accounts.
IAM Policies: Use managed policies and roles over inline policies. Avoid using root account for daily tasks.
Role-based Access: Use IAM roles for applications that need access to AWS resources, not hardcoded credentials.
2. Data Protection:
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using TLS/SSL) and at rest (use AWS KMS for encryption).
Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement regular automated backups with snapshots of your EC2 instances, databases, and storage volumes. Use services like AWS Backup or S3 versioning.
S3 Bucket Security: Ensure S3 buckets are private by default, use bucket policies and block public access settings, and enable server-side encryption.
3. Network Security:
VPC Segmentation: Use Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) with proper network segmentation and isolation for security-sensitive resources.
Security Groups and NACLs: Use security groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic, only allowing necessary protocols and ports.
VPN and Direct Connect: Use VPN or AWS Direct Connect for secure connections to on-premise environments.
Private Subnets: Place sensitive resources, such as databases and application servers, in private subnets with no direct internet access.
4. Monitoring and Logging:
AWS CloudTrail: Enable CloudTrail across all accounts for auditing and tracking API calls and actions.
AWS CloudWatch: Set up CloudWatch to monitor infrastructure, set alarms, and respond to changes in utilization, performance, and security.
GuardDuty: Enable GuardDuty for intelligent threat detection, and monitor findings for potential security risks.
VPC Flow Logs: Capture and monitor VPC flow logs to analyze traffic patterns and detect any anomalies.
5. Incident Response:
Automated Responses: Set up automated incident responses using AWS Config, CloudWatch Events, and Lambda for remediation tasks.
Playbooks: Develop incident response playbooks for specific threats, such as DDoS attacks or compromised credentials, using AWS services like AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
Simulations: Test incident response plans regularly using simulated attacks to ensure preparedness.
6. Compliance and Governance:
AWS Config: Use AWS Config to track changes to resources and ensure compliance with security policies.
Security Hub: Utilize AWS Security Hub to centralize security alerts and compliance checks across all your AWS accounts.
Encryption Compliance: Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by using encryption mechanisms and maintaining audit logs.
7. Patch Management:
Automated Patch Management: Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching for EC2 instances.
Regular Updates: Regularly update software, services, and libraries to the latest security patches.
8. Application Security:
API Gateway Security: Secure APIs using AWS API Gateway with usage plans, throttling, and API keys.
WAF (Web Application Firewall): Use AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to manage sensitive information like database credentials and API keys securely.
9. Key Management:
Rotate Keys Regularly: Regularly rotate encryption keys and IAM credentials using AWS KMS and Secrets Manager.
Limit Access to Keys: Restrict access to keys only to applications or services that need them.
10. Security Audits and Penetration Testing:
Regular Audits: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability scans to detect weak points in your infrastructure.
Penetration Testing: Periodically conduct penetration testing to simulate attacks and assess the security of your AWS environment. Follow AWSâ€™s policies on authorized pen testing activities.
