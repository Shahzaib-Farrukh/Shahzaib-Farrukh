I wanted to clarify a significant misunderstanding regarding our use of SendGrid. We are not utilizing SendGrid for marketing purposes. Our use of SendGrid is strictly limited to the distribution of notes and assignments among our internal associates, which include college faculty and students.

The links contained in our emails are simply notes and assignments for academic purposes. We kindly request that you verify these links manually to confirm their nature.

We hope this clears up any confusion and appreciate your understanding and assistance in resolving this matter.

ThankÂ you
