For every mkt site do this when they are good.

Create AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
Create EBS Snapshots
Automate Backups Using AWS Backup

Apply the below for the above
Use Tags and Naming Conventions 
Monitor Backup Health (use cloud Watch)

1. Backup Task Definitions
Steps:
Export Task Definition: Go to the ECS console, navigate to your task definition, and choose the latest version.
Click Actions > View JSON.
Save the JSON file locally or in a version control system (e.g., Git).

2. Backup Container Images
Steps:
Ensure your Docker images are stored in a reliable container registry like Amazon ECR or Docker Hub.
Tag your images with a version number or commit hash before pushing them.
Pull and Push Commands:
docker pull <image>:<tag>
docker tag <image>:<tag> <repository>/<image>:<backup-tag>
docker push <repository>/<image>:<backup-tag>

3. Backup ECS Service Configuration
Steps:
Go to the ECS console and select the cluster.
Choose the service you want to back up.
Document or export service configuration details like load balancers, desired count, and deployment settings.

4. Backup Cluster Configuration
Steps:
Document your ECS cluster configuration, including cluster name, instance type, auto-scaling policies, and network settings.
If using EC2 launch type, ensure your EC2 instances are backed up with AMIs or snapshots.

5. Backup Environment Variables and Secrets
Steps:
List all environment variables used in your task definitions.
Backup secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store by exporting them to a secure location.

6. Automate Backups Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Steps:
Use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define your ECS infrastructure.
Store IaC templates in a version control system for automated backups and easy recovery.

7. Test Backup Integrity
Steps:
Deploy a test environment using your backed-up task definitions, container images, and service configurations.
Verify that the deployment works as expected and matches the original setup.

8. Monitor and Audit Backups
Steps:
Set up CloudWatch or AWS Config to monitor changes in ECS configurations.
Regularly review and audit your backup processes to ensure they are up to date and effective.
