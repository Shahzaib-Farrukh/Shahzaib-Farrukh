Changes to systems within the development lifecycle shall be controlled by the use of formal change control procedures. Change control procedures and requirements are described in the Boundless Learning Operations Security Policy.

Significant code changes must be reviewed by the DevOps Team and approved by Erwin Llereza before being merged into any production branch in accordance with the Boundless Learning process. Our infrastructure changes are managed using Agile methodologies, specifically through sprint cycles, ensuring that all tasks are completed within defined time frames and are ready for review.

Change control procedures shall ensure that the development, testing, and deployment of changes are not performed by a single individual without approval and oversight.
