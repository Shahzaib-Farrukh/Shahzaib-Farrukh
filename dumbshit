Vulnerability 1: Linux Kernel Use-After-Free in Netfilter
Package: kernel
Installed Version: 4.14.330-250.540.amzn2.aarch64
Required Version: 4.14.336-256.559.amzn2
Severity: High
Risk Level: Critical
CVE: CVE-2024-1086
Vulnerability Description: A use-after-free vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component that could potentially be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. This flaw exists due to a mishandling in the nft_verdict_init() function which could cause a double free vulnerability when nf_drop is issued.
Impact: This vulnerability could allow an attacker with local access to escalate their privileges on the affected system.
Remediation Steps: Immediate upgrade to the patched kernel version is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability. The required version, 4.14.336-256.559.amzn2, contains the necessary fixes to address this issue.
